# algorithms
A repository for implementations of standard algorithms in Ruby (and, where circumstances require, Java). As part of my work for The Odin Project and a series of online algorithms courses, I'll be writing implementations several different algorithms. Rather than clutter up github with a dozen different repos, I'm going to drop them all in here. 
For Ruby-based implementations, I'll eventually add an RSpec-based test suite.
